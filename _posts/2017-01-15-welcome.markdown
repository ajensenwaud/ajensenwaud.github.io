Welcome to my new blog hosted here in Github. It has been a while since I have been blogging. Having spent too much time configuring and hosting the likes of Wordpress and Ghost, I decided to go with a simple Git-based blog using Jekyll. So far it looks quite nice.

The purpose of this blog will be to track my technical endeavours into everything code, UNIX, and a bit of running as well. I have started tracking my daily runs on Strava and will be posting an ongoing update towards September when I will be (hopefully) running the Sydney marathon, four years since my last marathon there. Exciting times indeed.

Hang in there!

Anders

If you, like me, are stuck with the [Nike+ GPS sports watch](http://www.tomtom.com/nl_nl/images/Nike-SportWatch-GPS-White-Silver-v1.png), you have likely been tinkering with exporting track data from the watch to something more open  and shareable (for instance, sharing running data with other runners that do not wish to create a Nike+ account let alone own a Nike+ device). I happen to use [Strava](https://www.strava.com) for tracking all my runs (as do most other runners that I know), but unfortunately Nike do not provide any way of sharing data from their Nike+ software. Twice as unfortunately, Strava do not formally support the watch either despite Nike selling plenty of these devices.

Fortunately, [some clever guy has built a very easy 3rd party tool](http://nike.vinz.xyz/) for exporting runs once uploaded to your Nike+ account to Strava. BAsically, you set up two accounts; one on Nike+ and one on Strava, upload your runs as you normally would, and then open the site on this URL to push them across. It is very easy.

Happy running!
